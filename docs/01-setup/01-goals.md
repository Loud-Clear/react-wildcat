## Goals

Wildcat was created to allow front end engineers to use the latest features and tools the Javascript community has to offer without having to configure everything from scratch. There are three main goals behind the project:

## Progressive Web App First
- Try to bring an "app" like experience to end users without extra effort from the developer
- Take advantage of Progressive Web App tooling like service workers and precaching
- Do everything possible to give the end user maximum performance

## Universal Server Side Rendering 
- Pages should serve searchable, indexable, and cacheable content on first load
- Embrace the mono-repo: make it easy to have multiple sites, with multiple domains, in one codebase

## Excellent Developer Experience
- Lightening fast transpile time using web workers.
- No more excuses for not writing tests. Wildcat has protractor, istanbul, karma and protractor set up and working with one another through the react-wildcat-test-runners package.
